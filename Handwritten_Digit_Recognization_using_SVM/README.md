# Handwritten_Digit_Recognization_using_SVM
In this model we are using the inbuild datasets of sklearn ie. digits.  
I trained the model using Linear Kernel and it proved to get an accuracy of 97.11%  
But after i played around with other kernel and got to know that rbf kernel with a gamma values of 0.001 & C = 0.7 proved to have an accuracy of 99.77%
